# Data Analysis Project

This repository contains a personal project focused on **data cleaning, database creation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)**. Developed by **Álvaro Huisman**, the project showcases the full data pipeline—from raw data to actionable insights.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Import and inspect multiple raw `.csv` files
   - Handle missing values, inconsistencies, and formatting issues
   - Standardize and prepare data for relational modeling

2. **Relational Database Design**  
   - Design and implement a normalized database schema
   - Load the cleaned data into a relational database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL)
   - Ensure referential integrity and optimize table relationships

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Query the database to extract relevant data
   - Perform statistical summaries, visualizations, and trend analysis
   - Generate insights and document observations

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- SQL (SQLite or PostgreSQL)
- SQLAlchemy (for database integration)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks

## Goals

- Practice real-world data cleaning techniques
- Understand the principles of relational database design
- Apply EDA to uncover patterns and generate insights from structured data
- Develop reusable workflows for end-to-end data analysis
