# Data Analysis Projects

This repository contains a collection of data analysis projects developed or co-developed by Álvaro Huisman. Each project explores different aspects of working with data — from cleaning and transformation to visualization and insight generation.

## Focus Areas

- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
  Handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and preparing raw datasets for analysis.

- **Relational Databases**  
  Structuring data into relational models to enable robust querying and exploration.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Applying statistical and visual techniques to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations.

- **Insight Communication**  
  Presenting findings clearly through visualizations and concise reporting.

## Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Jupyter)
- SQL (SQLite, PostgreSQL)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- SQLAlchemy
- Google Colab, VS Code

## Goal

To practice and showcase end-to-end data analysis workflows using real-world and synthetic datasets, building strong foundations in both technical and analytical skills.

Additional projects will be added over time as part of ongoing learning and experimentation.
