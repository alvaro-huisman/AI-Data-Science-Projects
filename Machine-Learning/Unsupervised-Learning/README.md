# Unsupervised Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of personal and academic projects related to **Unsupervised Machine Learning**. These projects have been developed and/or collaboratively worked on by **√Ålvaro Huisman** as part of ongoing learning, research, and experimentation in the field of machine learning.

## Contents

- Clustering algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering)
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP)
- Anomaly detection
- Visualization techniques
- Custom implementations and comparisons
- Real-world dataset applications

## Goals

- Understand the theoretical foundations of unsupervised learning methods
- Practice applying unsupervised techniques to various types of data
- Compare the performance of different algorithms
- Gain insights from high-dimensional data through visualization

## Technologies

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy / Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly
- Jupyter Notebooks

## Datasets

Most projects use publicly available datasets from sources such as:
- UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Kaggle
- OpenML

## Usage

Feel free to explore the notebooks, experiment with the code, and adapt it to your own projects. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
