# Supervised Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of personal and academic projects related to **Supervised Machine Learning**. These projects have been developed and/or collaboratively worked on by **√Ålvaro Huisman** as part of a continuous journey in learning and applying machine learning techniques.

## Contents

- Regression models (Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, etc.)
- Classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVMs, KNN, etc.)
- Ensemble methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost)
- Model evaluation and validation (Cross-validation, Grid Search, ROC/AUC, etc.)
- Feature engineering and preprocessing
- Real-world dataset applications

## Goals

- Deepen understanding of supervised learning algorithms and theory
- Apply models to solve practical classification and regression problems
- Optimize model performance through evaluation and tuning techniques
- Build a solid foundation for deploying and interpreting machine learning models

## Technologies

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy / Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly
- Jupyter Notebooks

## Datasets

Most projects use publicly available datasets from sources such as:
- UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Kaggle
- OpenML

## Usage

Feel free to explore the notebooks, experiment with the code, and adapt it to your own projects. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
