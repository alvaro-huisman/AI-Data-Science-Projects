# Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my collection of **Machine Learning** projects. This repository is organized into two main areas:

- **Supervised Learning**
- **Unsupervised Learning**

Each subdirectory contains a set of personal and academic projects developed or co-developed by **Álvaro Huisman**, exploring core concepts, implementations, and real-world applications of machine learning techniques.

                  │ 
                  └── Projects involving labeled data, including regression, classification, and model evaluation. 
                  │ 
                  └── unsupervised-learning/ 
                  └── Projects exploring structure in unlabeled data, such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.

## Goals

- Strengthen practical and theoretical knowledge in both supervised and unsupervised methods
- Build a solid portfolio of applied machine learning techniques
- Develop modular, reusable, and well-documented code for future reference
- Collaborate and learn through academic projects and personal experimentation

## Technologies

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy / Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks
