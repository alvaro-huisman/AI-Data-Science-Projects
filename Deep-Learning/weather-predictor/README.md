# Predicting Next-Day Rain with a Deep Neural Network  
**Hands-On Project ‚Äî Machine Learning II ‚Äî Unit 1**

This project focuses on building a **deep artificial neural network** to predict whether it will rain the next day in a given location in Australia. It was completed by **√Ålvaro Huisman** as part of the coursework for *Aprendizaje Autom√°tico II*, using the **Australia Weather dataset**.

## üìå Objective

The goal is to solve a **binary classification problem** using historical weather data to predict the target variable `RainTomorrow`. The model was trained using a cleaned and preprocessed dataset derived from the raw CSV file provided in the assignment.

## üìÅ Dataset Overview

- Source: [Australia Weather Data on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arunavakrchakraborty/australia-weather-data/data)
- Original size: ~99,500 records, 21 features + target
- Cleaned dataset: 39,574 records and 21 features + binary target (`RainTomorrow`: 0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- Features include temperature, humidity, wind, pressure, cloud cover, rainfall, and sun exposure across various time points.

## üîß Project Workflow

### 1. Environment Setup

- Python environment with **TensorFlow** and **Keras**
- Development in **Google Colab**

### 2. Data Preparation

- Used the provided `PreparingAustraliaWeatherDataset.ipynb` to clean and transform the raw dataset
- Resulted in two output CSV files:
  - `AustraliaWeatherPreparedCleanAttributes.csv` ‚Äì clean feature set
  - `AustraliaWeatherOutput.csv` ‚Äì target labels (0 or 1)

### 3. Neural Network Design

- Data split:  
  - **80%** for training  
  - **10%** for validation (dev set)  
  - **10%** for final testing
- Designed and tested various fully connected deep neural network architectures
- Manually tuned hyperparameters including:
  - Number of hidden layers and neurons
  - Activation functions
  - Optimizer (e.g., Adam)
  - Batch size
  - Learning rate
  - Number of epochs
- Final model used:
  - **Sigmoid** activation for output layer
  - **Binary crossentropy** as the loss function
  - **Binary accuracy** as the evaluation metric

### 4. Model Evaluation

- Training curves analyzed (loss and accuracy)
- Confusion matrix generated on test set
- Performance compared to the approximate **Bayesian error** of 5% for weather forecasting
