# Deep Learning Projects

This directory contains personal and academic projects developed by **√Ålvaro Huisman**, focusing on two key areas of **Deep Learning**:

- **Neural Networks**
- **Reinforcement Learning**

These projects explore the theory, implementation, and real-world application of deep learning techniques, with an emphasis on experimentation and learning.

## Contents

### üî∑ Neural Networks
- Basic feedforward (dense) neural networks for regression and classification
- Implementation with frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch
- Training techniques: backpropagation, optimization, regularization
- Model evaluation and tuning

### üî∂ Reinforcement Learning
- Development of RL agents in simulated environments
- Algorithms such as Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), and Policy Gradient methods
- Integration with platforms like OpenAI Gym
- Analysis of learning behavior and environment interaction

## Goals

- Deepen understanding of foundational and advanced neural network architectures
- Explore decision-making and reward-based learning through reinforcement learning
- Build solid implementations of theoretical concepts
- Strengthen practical skills with deep learning frameworks and tools

## Technologies

- Python
- PyTorch / TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenAI Gym
- NumPy / Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks
